## Introduction

I have created a simple online book review web app, it will allow users to be able to register to the website, so they can utilize everything the website has to offer. Users that are'nt registered will still be able to view all the books on show, and be able to view reviews that may have been left by other users.
If a user want's to be able to add a book to display on the website they must be registered and logged in, and if users want to leave reviews on any books on the website, they must also be registered and logged in. Registered users will also have their own profile page, which will allow them to view all the reviews and books they have added, users will also be able to edit and delete the reviews and books they've added.

## User Experience (UX)

    4. As a first time visitor I want to view individual products.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

Old Heroku Deployment Instructions
The site is deployed using Heroku. To deploy to Heroku:

1. To successfully deploy on Heroku we first need to create some files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

2. The requirements.txt file contains all the applications and dependencies that are required to run the app. To create the requirements.txt file run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

3. The Procfile tells Heroku which files run the app and how to run it. To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```

    NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

4. If the Procfile has been created correctly it will have the Heroku logo next to it. It is also important to check the Procfile contents, as sometimes on creation a blank line will be added at the end of the file. This can sometimes cause problems when deploying to Heroku, so if the file contains a blank line at the end, delete this and save the file. Make sure to save both these files and then add, commit and push them to GitHub.

5. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

6. Click the new button and then click create new app.

7. You will then be asked to give your app a name (these must be unique so you cannot reuse bookworm) and select a region. Once these are completed click create app.

8. You will now need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Select GitHub in the deployment section, find the correct repository for the project and then click connect.

9. Once the repository is connected, you will need to provide Heroku some config variables it needs to build the app. Click on the settings tab and then click reveal config vars button. You will now need to add the environment key/value variables that were used in the env.py file:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY | ANY_SECRET_KEY* |
    | DB_URL | postgresql:///readersrealm |
    | DEBUG | TRUE** |

    *Denotes a value that is specific to your app.

    **This is set to true to enable us to see any bugs on the live site. ~~Please change to FALSE after deployment.~~

10. You're now ready to click the enable automatic deploys and create button. Heroku will start building the app.

11. As this project utilizes a relational database, there are a few more steps to set this up.

12. On the heroku dashboard go to resources tab and then select add-ons. You will need to search for and select heroku postgres. For this project the hobby dev free tier is fine.

13. Go back into settings and reveal config vars. You should now see a new key called DATABASE_UL and the value should have been pre-populated.

14. We will now need to go the more button on the dashboard and select run console. This is where we will set up the tables in the database we have just created.

15. Type python3 and then once the python interpreter opens, we can run the following:

    ```bash
    from readersrealm import db
    db.create_all()
    exit()
    ```

16. Now that the relational database has been set up and the tables created, we can now click open app and the Readers realm application should now open in a new tab.

### Local Development

3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

#### How to Clone

To clone the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [ReadersRealm](https://github.com/Craig-Hudson/online-book-review).

3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.

4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.

5. Type the following command in the terminal (after the git clone you will need to paste the link you copied in step 3 above):

    ```bash
    git clone { & THE LINK FROM STEP 3 }
    ```

6. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required if you are using the Code Institute Template in GitPod as this will already be set up for you).

7. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file by running the following command in the Terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
