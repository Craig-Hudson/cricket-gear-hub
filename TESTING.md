## Overview

I used test driven development throughout the entire build for this project.
This includes using chrome developer tools to test for responsiveness and for general positioning of elements, I also used the dev tools and the terminal with the use of print statements in my python to help identify if there was any errors in the console and where the issues may of been arising from.

### HTML validator

I have used the html validator [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Initially many of my html files had either info's or warnings, which have all been corrected,
A couple of my html files had errors which have now also been fixed and are all clear of errors.

## Manual Testing

### Testing user Stories

- **First time Visitors**

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily browse products. | This was achieved by ensuring there are multiple links easily seen by users when they enter the website, and giving users access to links to view products no matter what page they may be on. |
| As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to checkout as a guest. | This was achieved by not putting any restrictions on my checkout functions for non-users, therefore allowing them to be able to purchase items. |
| As a first-time visitor, I want the website to be visually attractive and provide a good user experience. | This was achieved by using Bootstrap's utility classes and some of my own custom CSS. |
| As a first-time visitor, I want to view individual products. | This was achieved by allowing users the ability to click on any product they like the look of, to then be taken to an individual product's page, where users will be able to view the product in a lot more detail. |
| As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to search for products manually, rather than scrolling through the website. | This was achieved by adding a search bar in my `base.html` so users can search for products on any page on the website. |


- **Returning Visitor Goals**

| Goals  |  How are they achieved? |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  As a returning Visitor I want to be able to create an account. | This was achieved by using Django's built in package called allauth |
| As a returning Visitor I want a profile section on where I can view previous orders. | This was achieved by creating a profile app within my Django project, so that users have the ability to update their current address details, and also view their order history. |
| As a returning Visitor I want to be able to add/edit my current address. | This was achieved by allowing users to be able to edit their current address on their own profile pages. |
| As a returning visitor I want to be able to reset my password Incase I forget it. | This was achieved again by using the Django allauth package allowing users to recieve an email to click a link to reset their passwords.|
â€‹

- **Frequent visitor goals**

|  Goals | How are they achieved  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| As a frequent visitor, I want the e-commerce site to be mobile-friendly, so I can shop easily from my smartphone or tablet. | This was achieved by using bootstraps grid system using rows and columns, to determine how the website would look on different screen sizes ranging from mobile - p.c |
| As a frequent visitor, I want to leave reviews for products I have purchased, so I can share my experience with other customers. | This was achieved by adding reviews on the individual products page for logged in users to be able to add the reviews. |
| As a frequent visitor, I want to read reviews from other users, so I can make informed purchasing decisions. | This was achieved by allowing all users to be able to read reviews left by other users on the individual products page. |
| As a frequent visitor, I want my shopping cart to be saved across sessions, so I don't lose my selected items if I leave the site. | This was achieved by adding the users cart to a session storage, thus when users leave the website the items in their current cart will still be there, the cart is only reset when users have completed a purchase. |
